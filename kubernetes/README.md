# Kubernetes YAMLs

This folder holds yaml files that can be deployed using kubectl. You don't need to run any of these to do the initial setup, but they can be used for customization if you like.

The files in the `oscar` directory are files I use specifically for my hope setup. They are less likely to be useful, but might have some useful examples.
